"""Journal companion — knowledge store with working memory.

Mirrors website/docs/beta/code_examples/06_journal_companion.mdx. Persistent
agent memory using three primitives:

- KnowledgeStore — virtual filesystem for agent state.
- WorkingMemoryAggregate — LLM-driven summary rollup that runs at the end of
  every conversation and writes /memory/working.md.
- WorkingMemoryPolicy — assembly policy that reads /memory/working.md and
  injects it as context at the start of every subsequent conversation.

The agent therefore "remembers" what you told it even after a full restart,
because the state lives in the knowledge store — not in conversation history.

Run::

    python journal_companion.py
